## Installation

For local installation, clone the repoistory, then install all the package dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

Once that is finished, run the application:
```sh
npm run start
```

## FAQ

_The app used to work, but now nothing loads. Why?_

Newer versions may have data changes which causes the older data to be invalid. Since the app uses your browser’s local storage to remember your settings, progress, and layout preferences, the application and the data will be out of sync. When this happens, try clearing your browser’s cache and/or cookies and reload the page. While this project is in active development (version 0.x.x), this will continue to be a problem. There are plans to make a data converter from old versions (major) to the current one.

_Will feature XYZ be supported?_

Please open an issue for the feature you want. Prior to verison 1.x.x, this will only support glitchless logic. Various glitch modes will come post launch.

_Will other games be supported?_

The plan is to have just ALttP, and SM ready for launch. Other games are planned. Namely Zelda 1 and Metroid.
